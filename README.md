# MLOps-Case

This repository was created just as an example of how to develop the MLOps case.

The repository contains a dockerfile which allows you to build a docker image and run the code that quickly trains a model.

- To build the docker image run:
```
docker image build -t  mlopscase .
```

- To run the docker image:
```
docker run mlopscase
```
